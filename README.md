# Capstone Class Scheduler - Frontend

This is the frontend of the Capstone Class Scheduler application, built using [Angular](https://angular.io/) version 15.0.4. This app allows users to visually create and manage class schedules via a drag-and-drop interface, providing a more user-friendly experience for Miami University's class scheduling system.

## Features

- **Drag-and-Drop Interface:** A seamless drag-and-drop interface that allows users to easily add courses to their schedule. This enhances the user experience compared to previous methods, making scheduling intuitive and interactive.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive design ensures that the application works on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Changes to the schedule are reflected in real-time, making it easier for students to manage their course selections and schedule conflicts.

## How It Improves Miami Universityâ€™s Scheduling UI

- **Enhanced User Interaction:** By introducing a drag-and-drop functionality, this application simplifies the process of adding courses to a schedule. This improvement makes the UI more intuitive, reducing the complexity and time it takes for users to manage their courses.
- **Modernized Look and Feel:** The user interface has been modernized with a clean, organized layout that visually groups courses, times, and available slots. This makes it easier for students to navigate and customize their schedules.
- **Increased Accessibility:** The responsive design ensures that students can access their schedules and make adjustments on any device, whether on a desktop in the library or on their phone while on the go.
- **Efficient Conflict Management:** The app provides visual feedback when courses conflict with each other, allowing students to quickly make adjustments to avoid schedule conflicts.
